 ## Getting Involved

Third-party patches are absolutely essential on our quest to create the best maps app on android.
However, they're not the only way to get involved with the development of maps-app-android.
You can help the project tremendously by discovering and [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs),
[improving documentation](#improving-documentation),
helping others with [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Esri/maps-app-android/issues),
tweeting to [@ArcGIS_Runtime](https://twitter.com/ArcGIS_Runtime),
and spreading the word about mapps-app-android and the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/android/) among your colleagues and friends.

## Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug on the project's [issues page](https://github.com/Esri/maps-app-android/issues),
first make sure that your issue is caused by maps-app-android, not your application code.
Second, search through the reported issues for your issue,
and if it's already reported, just add any additional details in the comments.

After you made sure that you've found a new maps-app-android bug,
here are some tips for creating a helpful report that will make fixing it much easier and quicker:

 * Be very clear about your issue in the title. 
 * Include **hardware & android api version** info in the description.
 * Offer plenty of details to help others understand the problem.
 * If possible, create a **simple reproducible test case** to demonstrates the bug.
